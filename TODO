Some of these have specific locations in the source that need to be fixed.
grep for the appropriate tag to find these, e.g.:

    grep TODO1 *.ts

TODO1: Some settings are set to non-ed-compatible defaults.

TODO5: command_handlers.a doesn't handle nontrivial ranges
TODO6: command_handlers don't check ranges
TODO7: command_handlers.a doesn't update current_line.
TODO9: Warn when closing etc. a modified buffer
TODO10: options in Editor constructor
TODO11: test.ts: both input and print need to check end of test properly
